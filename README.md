After copying the program onto your machine, open an integrated teminal on the main folder or on the `index.js` file. Then, in the terminal, type in `npm i` to install the package manager. Once that is done, type in `index.js` to run the code. Inquirer will ask questions to specify how the svg logo should be created. Enter the information and an image of the logo should be generated on a separate file to be used for any purposes.
